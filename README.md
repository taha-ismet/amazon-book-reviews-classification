# amazon-book-reviews-classification
*I have scraped book reviews from amazon.com using python
selenium and 5 syncronised google collab notebooks in one gmail account. 
*Later used analysed this data
and used several learning algorithms to classify reviews by the number of stars given it has, using the text
of the comments. 
*Since the data was too little and number of stars given are so unbalanced, traditional
algorithms worked very little. 
*So I have used a lot of dimensionality reduction algorithms to better the
results.
